# EF4WSD: An Evaluation Framework for Long-tail Word Senses in Word Sense Disambiguation and Large Language Models

In Natural Language Processing (NLP), an excellent evaluation framework is crucial to the development of target tasks or fields. The Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) task has benefited from some excellent evaluation frameworks and has developed steadily. However, as models effectively identify high-frequency word senses, the current evaluation framework that does not distinguish between high- and low-frequency word senses (i.e., head and long-tail word senses) is no longer applicable. In addition, the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) requires some effective evaluation frameworks to protect their development. Based on the original evaluation framework of WSD, this paper constructs an evaluation framework to distinguish high- and low-frequency word senses, and the evaluation framework can be used to evaluate the ability of LLMs to understand and leverage long-tail word senses.
